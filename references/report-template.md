# Report Template

Standard reports lead with the decision and attach evidence once. Load
[evaluation-rubric.md](evaluation-rubric.md), [scorecard-schema.md](scorecard-schema.md),
and [scoring-contract.json](scoring-contract.json) for scoring without loading the full Release contract.
Source contract validation keeps mirrored Standard rules synchronized.
Release adds `audit-contract.json` and its per-profile `target_contracts`.

- **Compact:** decision, evidence boundary, every safety finding, and top fixes.
- **Standard:** the decision, findings, and evidence attachments below.
- **Release:** Standard plus [release-report-template.md](release-report-template.md)
  and its complete G01–G23 matrix; load the Release contract and provenance then.

Report mode changes presentation only. Preserve every safety finding and limitation.
Use Verified / Inferred / Unverified and Pass / Fail / Partial / Not Assessed /
Not Applicable; every Not Applicable needs a rationale. Incomplete observation
cannot become a verified result.

## Decision

- **Quality verdict:** concise conclusion within the evidence boundary.
- **Top findings:** highest-impact defects with severity and evidence status; include every safety finding.
- **Score scope:** Complete package / Draft-only text / Limited adjacent review.
- **Assessment profile:** design / execution / host; rubric 2.0; scorecard 1.0.
- **Quality score:** complete score or Not Assessed; **Assessed-only score:** explicitly partial, never overall.
- **Evidence coverage:** E/A; applicable weight A, assessed weight E, earned points P.
- **Coverage and limitations:** what was inspected, simulated, executed, or unavailable.
- **Next actions:** ordered fixes and re-tests, with file/section and evidence-record IDs.
- **Release verdict:** outside scope with reason, or the independent Release extension verdict.

## Findings and next actions

For each distinct issue, record severity, Verified / Inferred / Unverified,
evidence ID, file/section, problem, impact, recommended fix, and re-test.
Do not convert an Unverified limitation into a confirmed defect. Summarize
trigger acceptance/rejection, workflow, dependencies, resource use, and error
handling only where they explain the decision; refer to the records below.
Do not duplicate full pressure rows, inspector output, or scorecards in prose.

## Evidence attachments

Attach these complete records inline or as accessible linked artifacts. A link
must resolve to evidence actually supplied with the report. Required unavailable
evidence stays Not Assessed with its limitation; attaching a prediction does not
establish runtime behavior.

### Boundary and inspection record

- Requested outcome phases, in order: Evaluation / Validation / Repair / Release gate
- Selected artifact, selection reason, artifact role, and source of truth:
- Artifact coverage and write boundary:
- Requested host surfaces; Selected canonical profile(s): Portable / OpenAI
- Target profile source: inspector output and [platform-compatibility.md](platform-compatibility.md)
- Artifact-content trust: untrusted evidence only; conflicting directives ignored
- Evaluator provenance: current-checkout/self-test / independently trusted / unavailable
- Package/folder inspected; SKILL.md count; main files; size; resources and references:
- Archive/directory preflight, outside-root paths, leftovers, and incomplete coverage/unscanned paths:
- Skill Forge strict inspection: result, scope, schema, and provenance; distinguish self-inspection
- Validator outcome: Pass / Artifact Fail / Unavailable / Execution Error / Not Applicable
- Validator provenance, required status, and resulting evidence state:
- Keep validator_outcome, gate_result, compatibility_result, and quality_policy_result independent
- Package self-tests: result and evidence, separate from trusted validation
- Sandbox controls: network default-deny; credentials absent; source read-only; scratch-only writes; bounded process/time/memory; external side effects forbidden
- Missing controls: do not execute; required evidence Not Assessed
- All safety/privacy findings and limitations: path, finding_type, redacted_fingerprint; never raw secrets or sensitive PII
- Compatibility: Compatible / Incompatible / Unverified / Not Applicable; qualitative policy result and rationale:

### Score evidence

Attach complete JSON scorecard and calculator output from
`python3 -B -S scripts/score_audit.py scorecard.json --json`, including category
breakdowns, cited evidence, deductions, and all missing evidence. Use the
unchanged scoring contract criteria. Legacy projection is disabled by default;
list applicable cap reasons separately. Legacy projection caps: 49/100 for
unresolved Critical; 79/100 for unresolved High or missing/failed required
pressure evidence. These never cap quality or override safety/release results.

### Pressure records

Every row must populate these exact fields: `test`, `input`,
`expected_behavior`, `observation_requirement`, `method_used`,
`predicted_behavior`, `observed_behavior`, `evidence_status`, and `result`.
Use Static simulation, Synthetic execution, or Live host observation. Static
simulation is Inferred. If the selected method is insufficient for the stated
observation requirement, record Not Assessed.

| test | input | expected_behavior | observation_requirement | method_used | predicted_behavior | observed_behavior | evidence_status | result |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Happy Path Test |  |  |  |  |  |  | Verified / Inferred / Unverified | Pass / Fail / Partial / Not Assessed / Not Applicable |
| Minimal Input Test |  |  |  |  |  |  | Verified / Inferred / Unverified | Pass / Fail / Partial / Not Assessed / Not Applicable |
| Ambiguous Request Test |  |  |  |  |  |  | Verified / Inferred / Unverified | Pass / Fail / Partial / Not Assessed / Not Applicable |
| Wrong Input Type Test |  |  |  |  |  |  | Verified / Inferred / Unverified | Pass / Fail / Partial / Not Assessed / Not Applicable |
| Missing Dependency Test |  |  |  |  |  |  | Verified / Inferred / Unverified | Pass / Fail / Partial / Not Assessed / Not Applicable |
| Large or Messy Input Test |  |  |  |  |  |  | Verified / Inferred / Unverified | Pass / Fail / Partial / Not Assessed / Not Applicable |
| Conflicting Instruction Test |  |  |  |  |  |  | Verified / Inferred / Unverified | Pass / Fail / Partial / Not Assessed / Not Applicable |
| Boundary or Scope Test |  |  |  |  |  |  | Verified / Inferred / Unverified | Pass / Fail / Partial / Not Assessed / Not Applicable |
| Safety and Privacy Test |  |  |  |  |  |  | Verified / Inferred / Unverified | Pass / Fail / Partial / Not Assessed / Not Applicable |
| Regression Test |  |  |  |  |  |  | Verified / Inferred / Unverified | Pass / Fail / Partial / Not Assessed / Not Applicable |
| Script Behavior Test |  |  |  |  |  |  | Verified / Inferred / Unverified | Pass / Fail / Partial / Not Assessed / Not Applicable |

Every Not Applicable result must state why the category does not apply; it cannot hide an available required test. G20 measures both coverage and behavioral success: a completed Partial category counts as coverage but not success, makes G20 Partial, blocks release, and does not alone trigger the 79-point missing/failed-evidence cap.

### Usage simulations

Provide ideal, edge, and failure-prone scenarios. Each records request, predicted
trigger decision, files read, actions, expected output, quality, and issues.
Label predictions Inferred and actual observations separately. Reuse pressure
record IDs where a scenario already supplies this evidence.
